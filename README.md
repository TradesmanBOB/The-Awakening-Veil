# The Veil Realms

A tutorial game designed to improve your skills with each genre you enter and explore. Each genre and its challenges help you build skills that can be applied to other games, which is especially beneficial for those who are new or have limited experience in gaming.

## Project Overview

This repository is a display of a visual design document, allowing a reader to experience the protagonist's journey and step into their role, while allowing myself, the developer, to write the design document without focusing too much on the technical side. The technical side, being that of a Game Design Document (GDD). As stated previously, it is more technical than what I've written, because that isn't a GDD, what is a GDD, is something that contains things like: the concept, gameplay mechanics, slight story, tools used etc among other aspects.

## Getting Started

To get started, open the preview in the 'About' section on the right-hand side of this page. Then, click one of the intro pages to begin reading. Enjoy the story!

<!-- will need to rewrite this, when I finalize an intro and continue the story. -->
## Updates

Once I choose an intro, the other page will be renamed and rewritten into a second part continuing from it. Currently, I am undecided about which intro page to choose.

## Notes

The story is significantly assisted by AI prompting, primarily for help with descriptive scene setting. Though the core ideas and layouts are still my own, I often end up manually rewriting suggestions, sentences, paragraphs, or sections to accommodate even small changes to wording, whether the change is mine or the AI's.

Personally, I am not usually this verbose, but because of the assistance, the story has come out fluffier than my usual writing. As I've been told, the more I write, the more I'll become the kind of writer who can naturally add fluff to a piece.
