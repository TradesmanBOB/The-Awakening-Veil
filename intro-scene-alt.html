            You awaken upon a vast grassy plain, the wind weaving through the endless expanse. The land stretches untouched, with no signs of roads, settlements, or life beyond the rustling grass. The sky above is open and vast, the air crisp and carrying the scent of earth and distant water. It is a world undisturbed, as if waiting. Only then does something more refined catch your eye—a crescent shaped cliff cradling a small lake, its waters still in the embrace of the sheer rock face.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-scene-alt-p p2">
            At the water&#39; edge, seated on a simple rock, an elderly fisherman tends to his line. His expression is calm, almost content, yet there&#39; an undeniable sense that he is watching—felt like a weight upon your back. He never looks directly at you—until, for a single moment, you meet his gaze. His smile fades. His face shifts, subtle yet deeply unsettling, as if something momentarily puppeted his expression. Then, in a voice not entirely his own, he utters a cryptic remark: &quot;The veil parts only for those who would keep it safe… and explore beyond.&quot;
        </p>
        <p class="intro-scene-alt-p p3">
            A beat passes, the tension lingering—and then, just as suddenly, his face softens, and he chuckles as if nothing happened. &quot;Not much bites this time of day. Maybe later.&quot; He returns to his fishing, uninterested in you once more.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-scene-alt-p p4">
            The great door, towering and immense, begins to move. A deep, rolling rumble fills the air, vibrating through the stone as it grinds aside, revealing the vast hall beyond. The sound echoes endlessly, swallowed by the immeasurable space, until at last, the door settles, leaving only stillness in its wake.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-scene-alt-p p5">
            Inside, towering pillars vanish into shadow, their scale immeasurable. The air is thick, ancient. Ahead, a mound of sand rises in the cavernous expanse, crowned by a massive archway. Within the arch, mist coils and shifts, parting noiselessly. Flickering braziers cast uneven light along the way, their embers the only movement in the silence.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-scene-alt-p p6">
            Just beside the arch, an orb of light hovers in place, its glow gentle but constant, almost alive. The air around it hums with energy, though the source of this power remains elusive. Its soft radiance seems to anchor the otherwise surreal atmosphere, a small point of focus amidst the enormity. As you step closer to the door, the orb pulses in sync with your movements, as if beckoning you to come closer.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-scene-alt-p p7">
            Near the base of a towering pillar across from the portal, you find the remains of an old camp. Aged and tattered cloth hangs limply from where it was once tied, forming a makeshift shelter. Scattered belongings lie half buried in the sand, untouched by recent hands. Among them, a single weathered journal catches your eye. As you reach for it, the air shifts.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-scene-alt-p p8">
            Footsteps. Rapid, urgent. Someone—something—is running.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-scene-alt-p p9">
            Before you can react, a figure emerges from the shadows, their form barely glimpsed before they charge straight past you. Without hesitation, they dive through the portal ahead. The mist within the arch flares wildly, shifting erratically, and the orb of light beside it flickers, its glow distorting unnaturally. The air crackles, and the steady pulse of the orb breaks into erratic flickers, its smooth radiance sputtering like a broken reflection. Something is wrong—something is different.
