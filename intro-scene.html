                <p class="intro-scene-p p1">
                    You awaken upon a vast grassy plain, the grass rippling like a sea beneath a boundless sky. There is nothing but the shifting sea of green, land stretching untouched by human civilization, raw is the world and nature here. The sky above open and vast, the air crisp and carrying the scent of earth and distant water. It is a blank world, ready for something, someone, perhaps.
                </p>
                <p class="intro-scene-p p2">
                    You wander through the vast plain, the scenery gradually shifting, as you happen upon a crescent-shaped cliffside, cradling a small, serene lake. Its waters mirroring the sky, but still in the embrace of the sheer rock face. The weather is calm, though a faint breeze stirs the air, carrying with it a slight chill. At the edge of the lake, seated on a simple rock, an elderly fisherman tends to his line. His weathered face is calm, almost content, but he mutters something under his breath as if frustrated by something. As you draw closer, there is no proof but an undeniable sense he is watching, felt like a weight on your back. Once in close proximity he stares directly at you, and speaks in a calm, casual tone about the peaceful day and his fruitless attempts at fishing. But as you listen, his eyes suddenly darken, his smile fades and face shifts, subtly deeply unsettling, as if something momentarily puppeteered his expression. He speaks in a voice not entirely his own, a low and eerie tone, his words taking on a cryptic edge as if possessed, &quot;The veil only parts for those who would keep it safe... and explore beyond.&quot; He says.
                </p>
                <p class="intro-scene-p p3">
                    A beat passes, tension lingering. Before you can ask or respond, his expression as instant as it started snaps to normal once more, and he returns to his casual demeanor, and soft face. And he chuckles as if nothing happened. &quot;Not much bites this time of day. Maybe later.&quot; He returns to his fishing, uninterested in you once more.
                </p>
                <p class="intro-scene-p p4">
                    Further along the cliffside, as you walk between the rock wall and the lake, something catches your eye, a great stone door shimmering into existence seemingly at your approach. It pulses with a strange warbling energy, every second solidifying upon the rock wall with a mystical reality defying sound. The great door, towering and immense, begins to move. A deep, rolling rumble fills the air, vibrating through the stone as it grinds aside, revealing the vast hall beyond. The sound echoes endlessly, swallowed by the immeasurable space, until at last, the door settles, leaving only stillness in its wake. With the doorway open and dust finally settled, you peer beyond. Into a deep, and massive grand hall shrouded in darkness. The air is thick, and ancient. The hall stretches far ahead and along both sides, cavernous and enormous, its vastness growing more overwhelming the deeper you enter with no end in sight. The ceiling rises beyond sight, supported by towering, immeasurable pillars that vanish into the darkness and shadow. In the far distance, a faint light flickers, barely perceptible, like the promise of something unknown.
                </p>
                <p class="intro-scene-p p5">
                    As you approach, the source of the light becomes clear: a hole in the ceiling, through which afternoon sunlight pours down, illuminating a massive pile of sand that forms a hill beneath it. At the peak of the hill sits an arch, and the mist inside it shifts and stirs. The veil parts, revealing a world beyond, but as you watch, it transforms. One moment, a bustling medieval city appears, its market filled with travelers and the clatter of hooves on cobblestone. In an instant, the scene dissolves, the vibrant colors and noise fading into the cold, metallic silence of a spaceship. Neon lights flicker across its sleek, metallic walls, the hum of its engines low but constant. But just as quickly, the ship&#39;s walls ripple and fade, and a wild jungle takes form, thick vines hanging from towering trees, with strange creatures darting between the underbrush. The shift is sharp, like passing through the veil between worlds.
                </p>
                <p class="intro-scene-p p6">
                    Between the pile of sand and the closest pillar, an orb of light hovers gently. It pulses and shifts, its glowing surface reflecting and matching the transformation of the veil, each new world flickering in the orb&#39;s depths. The orb casts a soft, ethereal light, its glow growing brighter with each change, as if it too responds to the strange rhythm of this place.
                </p>
                <p class="intro-scene-p p7">
                    Finally, near the base of the pile of sand, against the closest pillar, rests a small, barren camp. The remnants of a forgotten fire and scattered gear mark the spot, the camp abandoned and still. A dusty journal, half-buried in the sand, catches your eye. Its cover is worn, the pages yellowed with time, and it looks as if it hasn&#39;t been touched in ages. Nearby, a weathered helm sits in the dirt, fashioned of dark iron and crowned with curling ram&#39;s horns, worn as though passed through many hands and countless battles. Close beside it, a heavy, blocky firearm rests, its design brutish and angular, built more for power than finesse—still and silent, though its presence feels heavy, as if echoing memories of war. A jagged bone knife lies partially embedded in the earth, its edge still gleaming, as if waiting to be used again. The camp is hushed, a quiet space of forgotten purpose, overshadowed by the shifting light and the murmur of unseen realms beyond.

                <p class="intro-scene-p p8">
                    Footsteps. Rapid, urgent. Someone or something is running.
                </p>
                <p class="intro-scene-p p9">
                    Before you can react, a figure emerges from the shadows, their form barely glimpsed before they charge straight past you. Without hesitation, they dive through the portal ahead. The mist within the arch flares wildly, shifting erratically, and the orb of light beside it flickers, its glow distorting unnaturally. The air crackles, and the steady pulse of the orb breaks into erratic flickers, its smooth radiance sputtering like a broken reflection. Something is wrong, something is different.
                </p>
                <p class="intro-scene-p p10">
                    For a moment, you turn your gaze back toward the distant lake, the fields of waving grass, the fisherman... who is just gone? A fleeting unease settles within you, yet something within pushes you onward. The orb&#39;s erratic flicker draws your attention, its pulse now frantic as though reacting to the distortion in the veil. It is calling to you, the unseen rhythm of this place urging you to press forward. The mist in the archway stirs, and a new world awaits.
                </p>
                <p class="intro-scene-p p11">
                    Without hesitation, you take a step into the shifting veil. Willingly walking the path into the unknown, and walking with drive you are, dauntless of the future.
                </p>
